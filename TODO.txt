i want the quizzes page to include the "start quiz button" (bigger) and thats it , at the default state.
The "Add New Question" and "Select Active User" should be in the Dashboard page
The "User Progress" Button is not needed, since it can be found in the sidebar
The Settings page will include the "Load Data", The "Save Data" and the "Reset", and these buttons will disappear from the bottom section (the bottom section will stay , but with just some small copyright text)
The colors in the results after the quiz should be improved
The reset button should have a warning/confirm option
the reset button should bring the app to the same state as refresh
