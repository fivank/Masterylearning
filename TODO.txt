the app should save at which dates and times each question was answered in the json file , not only the last time, but the times before, both for correct and incorrect. Then the app should use this information for a more intelligent way of building the next quiz: in the next quiz will be included not only questions not answered, but also the questions answered wrongly. In addition to that, the questions answered correctly, will be evaluated by how often it were answered wrongly and correctly and when these questions were answerd correctly, so that at the right time the questions will be added to the quiz for implementing a smart spaced repetition method for better learning.
