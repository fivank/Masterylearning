in the results after the quiz the color of the return to main menu should be also same color as the others

The reset button should have a warning/confirm option
the reset button should bring the app to the same state as refresh

the finish early button should also work when the user didnt answer any question

the app should save at which dates and times each question was answered in the json file , not only the last time, but the times before, both for correct and incorrect. Then the app should use this information for a more intelligent way of building the next quiz: in the next quiz will be included not only questions not answered, but also the questions answered wrongly. In addition to that, the questions answered correctly, will be evaluated by how often it were answered wrongly and correctly and when these questions were answerd correctly, so that at the right time the questions will be added to the quiz for implementing a smart spaced repetition method for better learning.
